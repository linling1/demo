                For the original post, start at the bottom.\n\nI posted about this situation a few weeks ago and so much has happened! \n\nFirst things first, we got the paternity test results back and 99.9% my kid. I never really doubted that she was mine but it feels amazing to know. \n\nWe’ve spent the past few Saturdays together and I’m learning so much about her. She’s incredibly intelligent and silly and she’s a great kid. I really hate that I missed out on so much but I don’t plan to miss out on anything from now on. We’re working on a custody arrangement  and I’m excited to see what the future has in store for us. \n\nI appreciate everyone’s kind words/advice and I’ve been doing my best to be there for her the way that my dad was for me. I’m enjoying this new role that I’ve been given. It makes me feel a sense of pride and a sense of purpose. I know that this isn’t always gonna be this easy but I’m incredibly grateful for this opportunity as a whole.\n\nOriginal post:\n\nI found out in late November/early December that I have a 6 year old daughter. I’m a 25 year old guy and her mom is someone that I slept around with my freshman year of college. She was a senior and graduated December of my freshman year and we never talked after she left. I never thought it was more than anything but us being young and having fun. But come to find out, I have a 6 year old daughter. \n\nWe met for the first time on December 20th and it was awkward. Undoubtably, that’s my kid. She has my entire face and even walks like me. I don’t have any kids besides well her and I have no idea how to connect with her. Like I’m not just gonna forget she even exists but I don’t wanna be overbearing or anything. I haven’t told anyone about this. We’re having lunch again today and I got her a couple toys. \n\nHer mom wants me to have a relationship with her and has even offered to pay for a paternity test just in case I was having doubts. I just have no clue how to even create this relationship with her. I want to have a relationship with her and make up for lost time but I don’t know where to start. Please help me.
